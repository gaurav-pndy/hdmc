It is implanted under the skin in the subclavian area. For prolonged courses of chemotherapy, this is the most optimal option for comfortable treatment. In addition, a port system can be used for blood sampling, prolonged antibacterial therapy, parenteral nutrition, and/or frequent blood transfusions. Like any catheter, a port system can be used to administer contrast agents for MRI and CT or to deliver any intravenous medications.<br/><br/><b>Possible contraindications for port system placement</b><br/><br/>Placement of a port system is recommended by the physician based on clinical data and the treatment plan. Each case is considered individually, since all listed contraindications are relative. However, implantation should be approached with caution in the following cases:<br/><ul class='list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-2'><li>blood clotting disorders;</li><li>individual intolerance to port materials;</li><li>radiation therapy at the intended implantation site;</li><li>superior vena cava syndrome;</li><li>inflammation of the skin at the implantation site;</li><li>sepsis.</li></ul><br/><b>How is port system placement performed?</b><br/><br/>The procedure for placing a port system is not considered an operation and takes 30–90 minutes. The implantation site is disinfected, a local anesthetic is administered, the vein is punctured and the catheter is inserted. A small skin incision of no more than 3–4 cm is made, a subcutaneous pocket is formed, and the port system is placed in it. The incision is closed with cosmetic sutures, which fully heal within 2–3 weeks. The implantation site is protected with a special dressing that can be removed by the patient later.<br/><br/><b>What does the patient feel after the procedure?</b><br/><br/>The port system is perceived by the body as a foreign object, so pulling, aching and tingling sensations at the implantation site are normal. People have different pain thresholds; to reduce discomfort, painkillers prescribed by the treating physician can be taken immediately after implantation if necessary. Discomfort should completely subside one week after the procedure. Any unpleasant sensations are a reason to contact a physician immediately.<br/><br/>Also, in the early period after port implantation it is recommended to limit certain routine activities:<br/><ul class='list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-2'><li>avoid lifting heavy objects (over 5 kg) for 7 days;</li><li>limit visits to pools, baths, and saunas for 14–28 days;</li><li>refrain from intense physical exercise for 7 days.</li></ul><br/><br/><b>How to prepare for the procedure?</b><br/><ul class='list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-2'><li>Consult with the specialist who will place the port system and discuss timing and location of implantation.</li><li>Prepare and provide the physician with copies of tests and examinations:</li><li>complete blood count with leukocyte formula and platelet count – valid for 14 days;<ul class=' list-inside space-y-2 ml-6'><li>- complete urine analysis – valid for 14 days;</li><li>- biochemical blood tests (total protein, glucose, total bilirubin, creatinine, urea, ALT, AST) – valid for 14 days;</li><li>- coagulogram (fibrinogen, APTT, INR) – valid for 14 days;</li><li>- blood group and Rh factor – valid for 3 months or after the last transfusion if one was given within the last 3 months (on a form with an original stamp);</li><li>- phenotype – valid for 3 months or after the last transfusion if one was given within the last 3 months (on a form with an original stamp);</li><li>- anti-erythrocyte antibodies – valid for 3 months or after the last transfusion if one was given within the last 3 months (on a form with an original stamp);</li><li>- tests for infectious diseases: RW, HBs antigen, antibodies to HCV, HIV – valid for 3 months;</li><li>- electrocardiogram (ECG) – valid for 14 days;</li></ul></li></ul><br/>It is worth noting that the port system is usually implanted before systemic antitumor drug therapy (chemotherapy), and the set of tests and examinations is identical to those required for chemotherapy. Thus, you will not need to collect them twice. It is only necessary to correctly determine the timing of port placement. Provide the supervising physician with copies of medical documents about the oncological disease and prior treatments.<br/><br/><b>Preparation for port system placement on the day of the procedure:</b><br/><br/><ul class='list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-2'><li>Be sure to bring your passport and copies of documents if they were not submitted in advance.</li><li>Have a light breakfast in the morning; then refrain from eating for 6 hours and avoid any liquids for 2 hours before the scheduled port placement time.</li><li>Take routine medications, except for blood-thinning drugs (this should be agreed with the treating physician in advance).</li><li>Shower beforehand and, if necessary, remove hair at the implantation site. Note: we recommend wearing dark clothing.</li></ul><br/><br/><b>After the procedure</b><br/><br/>Usually, about 2 hours after port implantation the patient is ready to go home. Within a month one can fully return to normal life. The port system is one of the safest implantable devices: complications occur in less than 2% of patients.<br/><br/><b>Care recommendations for the port system</b><br/><br/>A port system can be implanted for a long term (several years or lifelong). With regular use, special care is not required because the system is flushed before and after use.<br/>However, if a break in treatment is planned, the port system should be flushed every 4 weeks. If the patient has entered stable remission, the port system can be removed. The removal procedure is also performed under local anesthesia.<br/><br/><b>Important:</b><ul class='list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-2'><li>Keep the card with the port system data and diagnosis, as well as the technical passport of the port system. Carry it with you, especially when moving to other cities or countries. Always inform medical personnel about the presence of a port system when undergoing CT or MRI (the port can be used to administer contrast agents).</li><li>The port system may ONLY be used with special Huber needles. Always confirm their availability with medical staff to avoid deformation of the silicone septum.</li><li>Symptoms that require immediate medical attention:<br/><ul class=' list-inside space-y-2 ml-6'><li>- burning sensation, pain, fever above 38°C, redness and swelling at the implantation site;</li><li>- swelling of the arm or bluish discoloration of the skin on the side of the implanted port system;</li><li>- pain during infusion of medications through the port system.</li></ul></li></ul>"

    "about": "Digital diagnosis of skin neoplasms is a modern, highly accurate method of examining the skin to detect any formations such as moles, pigmented spots, and nevi, and determine whether they are benign or malignant. This computerized examination allows early detection of malignant skin neoplasms, particularly melanoma. Studies show that planned dermatoscopy using AI increases early melanoma detection by 20%.<br/><br/><b>Why use AI-assisted dermatoscopy?</b><br/><br/>Digital skin neoplasm diagnosis is applied for:<br/><ul class='list-disc mt-1 space-y-2 list-inside'><li>Early detection of malignant skin neoplasms, including melanoma;</li><li>Differential diagnosis between benign and malignant neoplasms;</li><li>Detection of parasitic skin conditions (lice, demodicosis, scabies, etc.);</li><li>Detection of bacterial, viral, and fungal skin infections;</li><li>Assessment of nail plate condition;</li><li>Investigating causes of hair loss (alopecia).</li></ul><br/><b>When is digital skin neoplasm diagnosis important?</b><br/><br/>Indications include:<br/><ul class='list-disc mt-1 space-y-2 list-inside'><li>Uneven skin growths;</li><li>Irregular skin color (especially black-blue shades);</li><li>Changes in size, shape, or color of a lesion;</li><li>Itching, burning, or pain in a pigmented spot;</li><li>Bleeding or ulceration of any lesion;</li><li>High number of moles with light hair color;</li><li>Moles larger than 0.5 cm in diameter;</li><li>Appearance of lesions during pregnancy;</li><li>Lesions in individuals over 60 years old;</li><li>Family history of melanoma;</li><li>Pre-surgical assessment of any skin lesion.</li></ul><br/>Important: These symptoms may be early signs of malignant skin neoplasms. Consultation with a specialist is necessary. Health-Direct’s experienced oncologist-dermatologists conduct comprehensive AI-assisted digital skin diagnosis using the FotoFinder system.<br/><br/>AI-assisted dermatoscopy should be performed annually for individuals at risk of malignant skin neoplasms:<br/><ul class='list-disc mt-1 space-y-2 list-inside'><li>Frequent prolonged sun exposure;</li><li>Repeated trauma to moles or pigmented spots (from clothing, combing, etc.);</li><li>Regular chemical exposure;</li><li>Age-related skin changes.</li></ul><br/><br/><b>How is digital skin neoplasm diagnosis performed?</b><br/><br/>No preparation is needed. The patient undresses to underwear, and a special gel is applied. Using the FotoFinder system, the skin is photographed from multiple angles. FotoFinder detects preclinical-stage neoplasms, invisible to the naked eye, with 140x magnification. Examining one lesion takes 1–3 minutes; the full procedure usually lasts about an hour. Data is analyzed in the Moleanalyzer program, which compares the patient’s neoplasms with a global database using AI, generating a report on malignancy, benignity, or borderline nature. AI combined with oncologist-dermatologist expertise provides up to 98% accuracy. Patients receive a detailed report and a mole map to monitor new skin lesions.<br/><br/><b>Important!</b><br/><br/>Early detection of malignant skin neoplasms enables minimally invasive treatment with positive outcomes.
